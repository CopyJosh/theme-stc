# Hello Theme

A blueprint to develop your own themes.

This theme is minimal on purpose. It comes with a tiny set of files that you can use to get started.

## Install this theme

You can install this theme from within your Pagekit installation. Open the Marketplace in your admin panel, find the theme and hit the *Install* button.

Alternatively, you can clone this repository or download all files from Github. Make sure this theme is located under `/packages/pagekit/theme-hello`.

## How to develop a theme

Just code away in the provided files. However, you may also want to read the [Theme Guide](http://pagekit.com/docs/developer-guides/themes) in the Pagekit Documentation.

For further inspiration, have a look at the default [One theme](https://github.com/pagekit/theme-one) which makes use of many more Pagekit features.

## No styes included

The included `css/theme.css` lists all CSS classes that are rendered by the Pagekit core extensions (such as menus or the blog). These classes come without any styling. Add your own styling in order for your theme to make the default Pagekit views look pretty.

Alternatively, you can load CSS provided by the [UIkit front-end framework](http://getuikit.com/). This is completely optional, but will style the default views for you. The Pagekit admin interface and the default Pagekit themes are built with UIkit.
